Along with the Central Railway Station, Fort St George is one of the remarkable colonial structures in the city that hark back to the times of the British rule in India. Called the White Town, the fort was built in the 1640s to protect the trade interests of the East India Company, a brutal British trading firm with a private army that conquered, subjugated and plundered India for more than a century. Located at the edge of Chennai along the Coromandel Coast, the origins of the fort can be traced back to the history of the city itself. The fort was completed on 23 April 1644, on St George\u2019s Day, and hence christened St George Fort. The citadel led to the creation of a new settlement area called George Town, which enveloped the villages and eventually became Madras, or the modern-day Chennai. The fort was armed, locked and loaded through both the World Wars and most of the 18th and 19th centuries, in order to keep the French forces and local rulers at bay. A symbol of power at that time, its six-metre-high walls withstood several assaults in the 18th century. Fort Museum One of the main highlights of Fort St George is its museum. Known as Fort Museum, it houses a diverse collection of antiquities in well-organised galleries. As many as 3,661 artifacts from different ages of modern Indian history are displayed across three floors, which are divided into 10 galleries. The Portrait Gallery, for instance, exhibits the portraits and oil paintings of former rulers and Madras Governors such as Queen Victoria, King George III, Sir Arthur Havelock and Robert Clive. While the Indo-French Gallery features clocks, stamps, furniture, lampshades and centuries-old British coins, the Uniform and Medals Gallery displays the military uniforms, ceremonial dresses worn by and medals that were given to the soldiers who fought various battles in the Indian subcontinent. St Mary\u2019s Church Dubbed the Westminster Abbey of the East, the St Mary\u2019s Church is the oldest masonry building within Fort St George walls. Consecrated on October 28, 1680, the church is believed to be the oldest British building in India as well. It is said to have been built with the help of voluntary contributions from the English who inhabited the fort.

If you wish to know a bit about the history of Kerala, Tamil Nadu\u2019s neighbouring state, then there are few places in Tamil Nadu that are better than Padmanabhapuram Palace to explore it. Located in the Kanniyakumari district, Padmanabhapuram was once a part of the erstwhile kingdom of Travancore. It is considered that the palace is one of the oldest of its kind in all of India. Though now situated inside Tamil Nadu, the palace is owned and operated by the Government of Kerala. The core of the palace which was known those days as \u2018Kalkulathu Koikkal\u2019 was constructed in 1601 CE by Iravi Varma Kulaskhara Perumal who was the ruler of Venad between 1592 and 1609. Much of the other structures within the palace premises was built during the reign of king Marthanda Varma who dedicated the completed palace to lord Padmanabha Swamy, the tutelary deity of the royal family. Ever since the palace began to be known as Padmanabhapuram Palace. One of the largest wooden palaces in Asia, Padmanabhapuram Palace is spread over an area of 6.5 acres of land. The palace contains 15 edifices that are all rich in intricate and complex woodwork and sculptures. The palace was active till around the middle of the 19th century. Later, the palace was locked up and opened very rarely for royal visits. In 1935 Sree Chithira Thirunal Balarama Varma, the last king of Travancore joined hands with the then archeology department to restore and preserve the palace as a museum complex.\n        ",

One of India\u2019s finest engineering marvels in India is the much-acclaimed Pamban rail bridge in Rameswaram that connects the island of Rameswaram to the mainland. The Pamban bridge holds historical significance as the first-ever bridge built across the sea in India. The efforts for the construction of the Pamban rail bridge began as early as in the 1870s when the British government decided to expand trade connectivity to Sri Lanka. Stretching to about 2.2 km, and with 143 piers, it was officially commissioned in 1914. It is the second-longest sea bridge in India after Mumbai\u2019s Bandra-Worli Sea Link. The Pamban Rail Bridge works on the Scherzer rolling lift technology to allow ferry movement, which opens upwards at an angle of 90 degrees. The Pamban Bridge has always been marvelled at during the train journeys that offer jaw-dropping views of the blue expanse of the Arabian Sea. Considered to be the longest bridge in India constructed over the bay, the Pamban rail bridge used to be the only link between Rameswaram and the mainland until 1988, after which a road bridge was built parallel to it. The bridge has survived major cyclones that severely affected Dhanushkodi, the thriving part of the town. The bridge was later renovated and restored in just 46 days. It was further strengthened in 2009 for the transport of goods. A new Pamban bridge is also being constructed with state-of-the-art technologies which would make it India\u2019s first vertical lift railway sea bridge. The new bridge will be around 2.2 km long, and it will be possible to lift it to a height of 22 metres above sea level. The new construction is also expected to ease the influx of pilgrim visits to Rameswaram and Dhanushkodi every year.\n        ",

This 14 acre property with its Bungalow was built by Arunagiri Mudaliar. Lt.Col.John Carne Boulderson became the first Police Commissioner in 1856 as per the City Police Act of XIII of 1856. The once rented property now became the asset of the Police via Lt.Col.John Carne Boulderson on July 22, 1856. History Circa 1842: The Indo \u2013 Saracenic building that stands tall today as the police Museum was the first building of the city Police Commissionerate. This 14-acre property with its Bungalow was built by Arunagiri Mudaliar. Lt.Col.John Carne Boulderson became the first Police Commissioner in 1856 as per the City Police Act of XIII of 1856. The once rented property now became the asset of the Police via Lt.Col.John Carne Boulderson on July 22, 1856. The entire property with the bungalow was purchased for 21,000 Rupees. This heritage structure has undergone several changes, extensions and abuse in the late 1800s and 1900s. Under the reign of Lt.Col.M.S. Drever, the Police Commissionerate was shifted to a new building that was designed by Architect Robert Chisholm and located on the Police Commissioner\u2019s Office Road for a brief period. Once the Police Commissionerate shifted back to this old building, the temporary Commissionerate was used as the photography studio of the Police. Finally, this building has gained a high heritage value in the city and there this building needs to be conserved this building, The architectural wonder of this building is that the spatial quality has enabled it to adaptively house the museum. The original bungalow is a two-storied load-bearing structure with a grand portico that welcomes the visitors into a verandah that runs around the front periphery of the building, It transitions smoothly into the lobby that has an elaborate curved timber staircase that leads us to the first floor. This staircase has stood the test of time and has retained its historic fabric to date. The rooms were designed to be of large heights with tall windows flooding them with natural light and ventilation. Little did Commissioner JC Boulderson know that his office would reincarnate to be a museum for Tamil Nadu Police. The decision to restore the building to its original glory and the historic fabric is what makes the building\u2019s conservation story a beautiful one. We are taken back in time as we see the shut doors and windows opened up, the restored balcony, the original corridor with its high parapet walls, the original Madras Terrace roofing, and the walls plastered with the original recipe of the lime plaster (Chunam) used in the building a century ago. This restoration has brought the building back alive and makes us realise what it would have been like to live and interact in this building in 1882. Be rest assured that J.C.Boulderson\u2019s spirit was working overtime in ADGP Mr Amalraj IPS, working under the direct supervision of the then DGP Mr Tripathy IPS to get the building back in form and fit for another century. The surprise came when the Police Bosses voted against occupying the prestigious building again and instead chose to house their museum in the piece of art. By any standards, this building is itself a Museum object. Immense energies have guided this project. Mr Steve Borgia was invited as an honorary Executive Consultant to this project to make the dream come alive. Mr Steve with his team of architects and passionate heritage enthusiasts has put the Museum together, with articles and stories that can be found only here. He has also donated the largest taxidermies tiger in India, to honour the men in uniform. The seed is sown for posterity. Generations will pass by. But this Boulderson building and all its content will stand here singing praise to the men who protected human lives around. May the spirit of Boulderson and his men, this Sarcenian piece of Art, and all the objects it contains carry the past into the future.

Rameswaram has a vast number of pilgrims visiting its religious destinations as it is considered one of the four holy sites (Char Dham) among Hindus. One such destination that has great religious importance in Rameswaram is the Ram Sethu bridge. The Ram Sethu bridge, also known as Adam\u2019s bridge, connects Rameswaram to the Mannar island of Sri Lanka. The bridge is a 48 km long chain of natural limestone shoals. There are many fascinating mythological tales that narrate the reason for its existence. Ram Setu is mentioned in the epic Ramayana, as the bridge constructed by Lord Rama and his vanara (monkey) army. The bridge was constructed to cross over to Lanka to rescue Goddess Sita from the clutches of the demon king Ravana. In Valmiki\u2019s Ramayana, the bridge is described as Sethubanthan. The temple records here also seem to suggest that Adam\u2019s bridge or Ram Sethu was completely above sea level till 1480. It was submerged in the shallow sea due to natural calamities. As per other legends, it is also known as Adam\u2019s bridge because according to the Bible and the Quran, the first man Adam travelled through the natural bridge to reach Adam\u2019s peak in Sri Lanka. The name is believed to have been given by an East India Company cartographer who, after considering Abrahamic belief about the bridge, used the name Adam\u2019s Bridge on his map. Besides the myths, there are also compelling scientific theories that explain the existence of the structure. The Geological Survey of India (GSI) under \u2018Project Rameswaram\u2019 states that the islands of Rameswaram in India and Talaimannar in Sri Lanka were exposed between 7,000 and 18,000 years ago. By dating the corals, the survey indicates that Adam\u2019s bridge was formed about 500 - 600 years ago Scientists believe that the structure is a natural formation and that Adam\u2019s bridge is a large tombolo, which is a coastal formation of sandbars that connects an island across the sea to the mainland. Another theory suggests that this structure was formerly the world\u2019s largest tombolo that split into a chain of shoals with a change in sea levels a few thousand years ago. Various scientific studies describe it as a chain of shoals, coral reefs, sand spit or barrier islands. But the site remains an important landmark, attracting both pilgrims and explorers.\n        ",
